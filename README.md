# 🏠 Home Maintenance Tracker for Home Assistant

Keep your home in top shape by tracking recurring maintenance tasks right inside Home Assistant!

This custom integration helps you remember important chores like changing air filters, cleaning gutters, or testing smoke alarms — and shows you when they're due.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- 📋 Lets you create recurring tasks (e.g., “Change HVAC filter every 90 days”)
- 🔔 Creates entities in Home Assistant to be able to create automations and display on dashboards
- ✅ Lets you mark tasks as completed so it can track the next due date
- 📊 Shows tasks in a clean, easy-to-use interface built into Home Assistant

---

## ⚠️ Important Note
This integration was created to fill a simple but important gap in Home Assistant: the ability to create recurring tasks without relying on multiple helpers and automations. It is intentionally minimal by design — focused solely on task tracking.

Home Assistant already provides powerful features for dashboards, automations, and alerts, and this integration is meant to complement those, not replace them.

Because it's a custom component with limited scope and resources, not all feature requests will be added or considered — especially if the functionality already exists natively in Home Assistant or falls outside the intended purpose of the integration.

Thank you for understanding and helping keep this integration focused and maintainable.
